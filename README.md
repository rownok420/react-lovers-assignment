## About Project

- This is a simple react website.
- I've used react to develop the UI of this site.
- This app contains different <strong>Developer</strong> information.
- You can select developer and get estimate budget for hiring them.
- I used font-awesome for icons. And also used bootstrap for responsiveness and faster design.
- I created a json file, placed it locally and loaded data from it to show in the UI
